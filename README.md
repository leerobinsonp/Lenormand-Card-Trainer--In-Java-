# Lenormand-Card-Trainer--In-Java
This is a simple Java dropdown selection displaying descriptions of the different Lenormand Deck cards used in divination. See [Marie Anne Lenormand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Anne_Lenormand) for more on this. The coding based on a tutorial by [Andy Wicks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOV_oaJhABQ) and adapted.
